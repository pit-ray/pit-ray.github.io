<ul>
<li><span class="que">Why is the name win-vind?</span></li>
<p>win-vind means for <b>win</b>dows <b>vi</b>m key b<b>ind</b>er.</p>
<br>

<li><span class="que">Why is <span class="code">o</span> a right click and <span class="code">a</span> left click?</span></li>
<p>I regarded original-Vim's operation for changing from Normal to Insert (e.g. <span class="code">i</span>, <span class="code">o</span>, <span class="code">a</span>) as the aiming the caret position. Therefore I adopted these commands for deciding mouse positions. Additionaly, <span class="code">o</span> is also adopted as the decide key in my favorite Vim plugins like NERDTree.</p>
<br>

<li><span class="que">What is the GUI visual mode?</li>
<p>It is equal to hold mouse left pressing.</p>
<br>

<li><span class="que">I want to use Alt + Tab.</span></li>
<p>Please use <a href="https://pit-ray.github.io/win-vind/cheat_sheet/#switch_window">Switch Window</a>.</p>
<br>

<li><span class="que">Would it be possible to start without key-bindings and be turn on win-vind whenever my wants ?</span></li>
<p>Yes. You should set <b>GUI Insert</b> at <b>Preferences/settings/Initial Mode</b>.</p>
<br>
